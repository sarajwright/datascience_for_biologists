## Overall Instructions

For your final project, you will be analyzing a dataset of your choosing. Your goal will be to ask **FOUR** scientific/explanatory questions about your dataset, and answer each question with any necessary associated wrangling, modeling, and visualization to address *and/or complement* the question.


#### Ground rules


+ You must complete your project each using the respective Rmarkdown template, and it must knit without errors for full credit. The template should knit to HTML only.
+ Your Rmarkdown document must use an Rmarkdown document theme and code syntax highlighting theme of your choosing.
+ Every question requires a data visualization. _It does not matter which geoms you use for your plots_, as long as the plots are properly made and are relevant to/address your given exploratory question. 
  + In other words: IT IS OK if you have the same type of plot for multiple (or all!) questions, as long each plot answers your question appropriately!
    + *Carefully go over any HW feedback you have received for exploratory analysis to prepare!!*
+ You must ensure that all rendered plots are _fully visible and legible with an appropriate aspect ratio_. 
+ At least ONE question must be EITHER a linear model or logistic regression. You can do more models if you want, but only one is required on the project. **Associated ground rules:**
  + You do not need to use testing/training splits for model training and validation, but you can if you choose. *If you do this, you must ensure your random number seed is properly set, and your written text and code output are precisely consistent.*
  + You can either do a specific hypothesis-based analysis (your question is: "do these specific variables explain variation in/predict status of response?", for linear/logistic respectively) OR use model selection to determine predictors (your question is: "does the model explain variation in/predict status of response?"). 
  + If you perform model selection, make it easier on yourself: Use `step()` to perform model selection, and consider the literal output of using `step()` to be your model itself. End of story!
  + For any linear models, your explanation must include a brief interpretation of the model's RMSE and $R^2$. You are not required to interpret coefficients. There are several options for how you can include a visualization for this question, which we will discuss together based on your circumstance if you decide to include a linear model.
  + For any logistic regressions, your explanation must include a brief interpretation of the model's AUC. Your visualization must be the logistic curve itself.

## Project Proposal Instructions 

> Due Wednesday 12/1/21 by 11:59 PM. Timely submission is extremely important in case there are problems with your data's suitability for the final project and you need to find a new one. You will be able to resubmit the proposal for a full regrade if I do not approve it, as long as your initial submission arrives by the deadline AND knits without errors.

For your proposal, you will identify a dataset to analyze, using the provided template. You must choose a dataset that we have NOT used in class and you have not personally used for a `#tidytuesday` extra credit Some fantastic options for finding data include:

+ The `#tidytuesday` repository has a dataset for each week since 2018. 
  + https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday
+ The statistics website FiveThirtyEight has a bunch of datasets they have compiled (some of which have been used as `#tidytuesday`, actually!)
  + https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/
+ The website "Kaggle" has a *lot* of compiled datasets. _Depending on the dataset, you may need to make a free account on the website to download the data, but you do NOT have to pay._
  + https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
+ The Gapminder website has a lot of great datasets 
  + https://www.gapminder.org/data/
+ The UCI Machine Learning database
  + https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php
+ This website lists *a bunch* of other options
  + https://www.dataquest.io/blog/free-datasets-for-projects/
+ If you have read a scientific paper that you think has accessible data you want to use, *please reach out to me and I will help you track it down!*
+ If there is a specific of data from a certain field you want to use but you don't know where to find it, *reach out to me and I will help see if I can find one for you!*
+ If you find multiple related datasets from the same source (e.g. some `#tidytuesday` datasets have several CSVs associated with them), you can use them all and consider it "one" dataset.

#### For your proposal, you will...

+ Use the template!!
+ Introduce and briefly describe your dataset:
  + Provide a brief description (in your own words! do not plagiarize!!) of the data itself so anyone who views your analysis has a solid grounding to understand what you are doing!
  + Explain what excites or interests you about this data! Why did you choose it?
  + Include an _properly-formatted markdown link_ to the source of the data. Properly formatted markdown links are formatted as: `[text you want displayed](link)`. Please refer to the file `activities/rmarkdown_demonstration.Rmd` for further help.
  + Include either a bullet point list *or* a table (learn how to make a markdown table using resources embedded in `activities/rmarkdown_demonstration.Rmd`) that briefly describes all the variables (columns) in your data. If you obtained your data from a website that already contains such a bullet list or table description, feel free to literally use the same wording.
    + If there's an insane amount of columns in your data such that this is ridiculous (like 30+ columns), please talk to me about it.
+ Read in the dataset with `read_csv()` and display the dataset with the `dplyr::glimpse()` function. 
  + Your dataset will either be a literal file, or it may be available online as a URL (like the `#tidytuesday` datasets). If it's a URL, just read from URL as normal.
  + *If your dataset is a literal file,* being read in from a file and NOT A URL, you **MUST** take the following actions:
    + Ensure the name of your file (and hence the code to read it in) is called `yourlastname_dataset.csv` (or a different extension as approrpiate). For example, I would name my data file as `spielman_dataset.csv`.
    + Submit the dataset to Canvas along with your Rmd (multi-file submission.) If the data is not also provided, the Rmd will not knit, and you will not be able to get credit.
+ Indicate which variable you plan to model and whether you will be using linear or logistic regression. (Hint: it entirely depends on the type of data!)
+ **FOR BONUS POINTS!! (CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR GRADE??!?! DOING THIS BONUS WILL SERIOUSLY HELP! THIS!!)** 
  + Also tell me (casually is ok!) the other three questions you are considering asking for your final project, and to the extent possible, tell me about what kind of plot you are thinking of making.
  + Doing this bonus means I will give you direct feedback on your project ideas while I grade the proposal! We can even use this bonus to start a back-and-forth conversation (after this submission, can continue on Slack!) about how you can approach each of your questions. This initiative will set you up for much more success completing the project!

## Final Project Instructions

> Complete and push all code by Tuesday 12/14/21 by 11:59 PM. Whatever code you most recently pushed before this time will be your final submission. **To be clear: Even if you push commits AFTER the deadline, those code changes will not be considered at all.**
>
> Unless you have an _extremely_ extuenuating circumstance that we specifically discuss (in which case you are likely to get an "Incomplete" grade for the class), there are NO EXTENSIONS WHATSOEVER because this is equivalent to a "final exam." 


You must complete your final project using the template Rmarkdown file in your copy of the final project Github repository, which we will setup together as a class activity. 
<!--This repository uses special "Github Classroom" features. This means that at the deadline on May 7th 11:59 PM, Github will collect all of your repository history and code and automatically send it to me. If and only if your code commit history shows that no further work occurred after 11:59 PM on Tuesday May 4th, you will receive the bonus +10%. -->

#### Repository instructions


Your final repository should contain only these files: 

+ `README.md` (I have written this file for you)
+ The `.gitignore` file (I have written this file for you)
+ The `.Rproj` file associated with the project
+ Your final project as an Rmarkdown named `<lastname>_final_project.Rmd`. 
  + For example, I would call this `spielman_final_project.Rmd`. If you have two last names, you may use a dash: `last-name_final_project.Rmd` or choose to use only one - whichever you prefer!
+ Your final knitted project `<lastname>_final_project.html` (should be automatically named correctly if the `Rmd` is named correctly!)
+ Your dataset named `<lastname>_dataset.csv` (or `.tsv`, etc. depending on the file type)
  + Unless your data is being directly read in from a URL. If it's accessible from a URL, there does not need to be a separate file included in your project. 


<br>

#### Template

The project is templated out for you as follows:

+ The **Introduction** section should first briefly describe the dataset (you can use the exact text you used in the proposal), including a direct link to the data's source. You should then include code to read in and briefly explore the dataset so readers have a sense of the data. _Again, if you are reading data from a file, make sure the file is properly named._

+ For each **Question** section, you should provide your question (questions are _questions_, not tasks) as a level-4 header. Under the **Methods** sub-header, include _named_ code chunk(s) you need to wrangle and visualize data to answer the question and make your plot(s). Chunks should be reasonably named for the given task, and you can have as many chunks as you want as long as they are all under **Methods** and you ensure _that plot(s) are revealed as the last piece of code output in **Methods.**_ Then, under the **Answer** sub-header, provide your brief answer to your question.

<br>

#### How will you be graded?

This project is worth 20% of your final grade and is worth 150 points as follows:

+ **20 points for each (total is 4x20=80)** successfully-completed question and answer, where each question/answer must have at least one associated figure.
+ **20 points** for adhering to the format. This includes...
  + Placing code into their intended code chunk. For example, libraries should only be loaded in the setup code chunk.
  + Naming all code chunks
  + NOT using "forbidden" code like `View()`, `install.packages()`, etc. _If you need to use other packages that aren't already installed, please talk to me first!_
  + Setting your favorite Rmarkdown theme and syntax highlighting theme 
  + Ensuring all markdown elements appear in the knitted output as intended.
+ **50 points** for successfully completing the project with git version control
  + **8 points** are for your five required commits (total 40 points)
  + **10 points** for a properly organized repository with correctly named files according to instructions
  + If you do not use git for your final project (i.e. you write an Rmarkdown and _email it to me_ by the deadline), you can still get credit for your final project, BUT your maximum possible grade will be 100/150 (66.7%) since those 50 points are automatically lost.
