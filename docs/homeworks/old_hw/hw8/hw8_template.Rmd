```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# DO NOT MODIFY THE NEXT LINE:
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE)

# Load all libraries you use HERE, in this setup chunk:
library(tidyverse)
library(ggforce) # Needed for geom_sina() function
```

## Part 1

### Question 1.1

```{r read_wine_data}
# In this code chunk, read in both wine CSV files. You must use the `file.path()` function as part of your code
# Remember: read.csv() is NOT ALLOWED! read_csv() ONLY! This is for your protection.

```

```{r explore_wine_data}
# In this code chunk, explore the wine dataset so the viewers of the knitted document have a sense of the data as well as you do
# Remember: View() is NOT AN OPTION!

```

This text should be REPLACED with your text answer to this question. Again, remember, this is NOT A SCRIPT! This text is not a code comment - it is literal markdown text. *Outside of code chunks, it's just markdown text.*

### Question 1.2

```{r barplot_version1}
# Create and display the barplot made with wine version 1
# For display, you just have to "run the plotting code" - no need to save to a variable or print! Code chunks behave like "interactive Console code" in the final knitted HTML.
# Again, the function print() can be used but does not have to be.
# Remember to check width and height in the knitted output!

```

```{r barplot_version2}
# Create and display the barplot made with wine version 2
# Remember to check width and height in the knitted output!


```

```{r sina_version1}
# Create and display the sina plot made with wine version 1
# Remember to check width and height in the knitted output!


```

```{r sina_version2}
# Create and display the sina plot made with wine version 2
# Remember to check width and height in the knitted output!


```

### Question 1.3

```{r acidity_scatterplot}
# Create and display the scatterplot with the appropriate wine version here
# Reminder: Any exploration code to figure out WHICH wine version should not be included here. Just the wrangling and plotting.
# Remember to check width and height in the knitted output!


```

### Question 1.4

```{r wine_histogram}
# Create and display the faceted histogram with the appropriate wine version here
# Reminder: Any exploration code to figure out WHICH wine version should not be here. Just the wrangling and plotting.

```

## Part 2

```{r read_malaria_data}
# Read in the malaria dataset (again incorporating the `file.path()` function)

```

```{r explore_malaria_data}
# Brief dataset exploration

```


```{r malaria_lineplot}
# Create your lineplot showing malaria cases over time for three countries of your choosing
# Remember to check width and height in the knitted output!



```
