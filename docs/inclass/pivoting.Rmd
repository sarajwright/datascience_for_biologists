**BEFORE WE BEGIN, PLEASE UPDATE:** `ds4b.materials::update_materials()`


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse=TRUE)

# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ds4b.materials) # contains the datasets
```


## Pivoting

We go from wide --> long with `pivot_wider()`





# Same data! `messy1` is WIDE and `tidy` is LONG. How do we go back and forth?
# We use functions pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() from tidyr. ****We do not use spread() and gather() anymore - beware of the internet!!!!*****
messy1

tidy



# Let's so another one:


wine_version1  


wine_version2








# Goal: Make a faceted plot where total_cup_points is plotted across each of the other rating columns.
# This is analogous to question 5 on HW9!!!!






wine_version1


wine_version2


# select helper functions:
#everything()
#contains()
#starts_with()
#ends_with()

# and colons!
