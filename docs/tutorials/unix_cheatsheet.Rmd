### Directory
  - A *folder* on your computer which contains files. UNIX filesystems are organized as hierarchical directories. 
  - Forward slashes divide levels in the nested hierarchy of directories, e.g. `/top_level_directory/second_level_directory`
  - The directory at the top of this hierarchy is called the **root** directory and is denoted simply as `/`. 

### Path
  - The *address* to a directory or file on your computer. There are, generally, two types of paths:
    - **Absolute/full path** represents the path of a given directory/file beginning at the root directory.
    - **Relative path** represents the path of a given directory/file relative to the working/current directory.

## Fundamental UNIX commands

> Note that # are used for comments UNIX, just like in R (and python!)

Command | Description | Usage 
:-------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----
`pwd` | Display the path of the current directory (aka **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory) | `pwd  # yup that's it!`
`ls` | **L**i**s**t files and directories in current directory. |  `ls # yup that's it!` <br> `ls -l # display long` <br> `ls -a # show hidden files` <br> `ls -la # display long and show hidden files` 
`cd` | **C**hange **d**irectory | `cd path/to/where/I/want/to/go`  <br>  <br><br> `# Go one directory BACK` <br> `cd .. # one directory back. We move backwards with ..` 
`cp` | **C**o**p**y a file or directory (use `cp -r`). The original file is NOT changed, like "copy and paste" (`cmd+C`/`cmd+V`)| `Make a copy of oldfile.txt called newfile.txt` <br> `cp oldfile.txt newfile.txt`  <br><br> ` # Make a copy of the directory first_directory to be called second_directory` <br> `cp -r first_directory second_directory`
`mv` | **M**o**v**e or rename a file or directory. The original file is changed, like "cut and paste" (`cmd+X`/`cmd+V`) |  `# RENAME file from oldfile.txt to newfile.txt` <br> `mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt`  <br><br> `# MOVE oldfile.txt to live in the directory into_this_directory/`<br> `cp oldfile.txt into_this_directory/`  <br><br> `# MOVE oldfile.txt to live one directory back` <br> `cp oldfile.txt ..`
`touch` | Create an new (empty) file. | `touch name-of-the-new-file-you-want-to-make.txt` 
`mkdir` | Create a new directory/folder (aka **m**a**k**e **dir**ectory) | `# Create a new folder called new_directory` <br> `mkdir new_directory`
`rm` | **R**e**m**ove a file or directory (use `rm -r`). **This is PERMANENT!!!** | `# PERMANENTLY delete a file` <br> `rm file_I_dont_need.txt` <br><br> `# PERMANENTLY delete a folder` <br> `rm -r directory_I_dont_need/`
`clear` | **Clear** screen (can still simply scroll up for past commands! they aren't gone!). | `clear # yup that's it!`
`history`| View history of recent past commands | `history # yup that's it!`

`tab` (tab key) | autocomplete word
`â†‘` (up arrow)| scroll back through previous commands
`.` | Represent the current directory you are in.
