"],["course-description-and-requirements.html", "2 Course Description and Requirements", " 2 Course Description and Requirements Modern-day biological research produces volumes of data that all scientists need the skills to analyze. In this course, students will learn and apply foundational concepts in data science, including data visualization, wrangling, modeling, and communicating using open-source programming and reproducible frameworks. This course assumes no background in any computer programming or other computational skills. Upon completing this course, students will be able to: Apply the R statistical computing language (notably the “tidyverse” packages) to visualize, interpret, manipulate, and model (light modeling!) data Communicate data analyses using professional markup languages Utilize version control for code and data management, communication, and reproducibility Develop and address scientific questions using reproducible data science techniques There are no additional requirements for this course beyond having a computer (or tablet with external keyboard) with WiFi. You must bring your computer to all classes in order to fully participate with class activities. "],["covid-19-policies.html", "3 COVID-19 Policies 3.1 Mask Policy 3.2 Illness and Exposure Policy 3.3 If the professor gets ill…", " 3 COVID-19 Policies This classroom will prioritize safety and health as necessary prerequisites to learning. If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe at any point with in-person learning this semester, please do not hesitate to reach out to me to have a confidential conversation about your concerns and how we can work together to address them, within the context of Rowan University’s overall policies. We learn best when we are comfortable in our surroundings, so let’s figure out together how to remain comfortable. 3.1 Mask Policy Our classroom mask policy is aligned with the Rowan University mask policy: Rowan is requiring all students, faculty and staff, regardless of vaccination status, to wear masks in all indoor public settings for at least the first two weeks of the fall semester, Sept. 1-14. To be allowed in our indoor classroom and learning spaces, you must be wearing a mask, regardless of your vaccination status. In-person learning during a global pandemic is a privilege. Removing your mask in any way, including not covering your nose, is a sign that you do not wish to take advantage of this privilege. You will not be allowed to enter the classroom without a properly-worn mask. If, once in the classroom, you remove your mask to any extent for any amount of time, you will be immediately asked to leave the classroom and you will be regarded as absent with associated penalties. There are no exceptions. This is a zero-tolerance policy. Even if you you need to have a drink, step outside. If we experience a situation where student(s) refuse to wear a mask at all times over both mouth and nose or are unable to maintain compliance, class will be canceled. 3.2 Illness and Exposure Policy If you are experiencing ANY cold/flu symptoms or other COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. loss of taste/smell) in any way, or you have had a known exposure, please DO NOT FEEL THE NEED TO COME TO CLASS, AND IN FACT PLEASE DO NOT COME TO CLASS AT ALL! Any absences related to illness will be considered fully excused with no penalty. You will have full access to the class recording! If we experience a situation where student(s) are present in class with clear cold/flu/COVID symptoms, they may be asked to leave, and class may be canceled depending on the severity of the circumstance. 3.3 If the professor gets ill… Class will be canceled if the professor becomes infected and symptomatic with COVID-19 or any other cold/flu disease. Class will resume only once the professor has returned to full physical health. To reduce the chances of this happening, do not come to class if you are experiencing any kind of cold/flu/COVID symptom. "],["grading-policies.html", "4 Grading policies 4.1 Final grade calculations 4.2 Additional attendance information 4.3 Final grade boundaries", " 4 Grading policies 4.1 Final grade calculations This relative contribution of Attendance/Participation is subject to change based on how the semester progress with the pandemic. You will be immediately notified in case of any proposed grading policy changes, with an opportunity for class feedback and disccussion about proposed updates. Your final grade will be determined by three different components as follows: Weekly Assignments (65%) You can expect one assignment each week of the semester, with the lowest grade dropped (or, with one assignment skipped, depending on your perspective). There will be 11 non-dropped homeworks, so each homework represents about 6% of your final class grade. You are expected to complete assignments using your own code, but you are strongly encouraged to work in groups on assignments to master the topics and skills. Final independent project (20%) You will have a final independent project analyzing a data set of your choosing. More details will be announced as the semester progresses. There is no separate final exam. The final project will be due Tuesday 12/14/21 by 11:59 PM. Attendance and participation (15%) You are expected to attend and participate through coding engagement during all classes while adhering to all mandatory COVID-19 policies. Attendance with lack of participation or lack of complete adherence to COVID-19 policies will be considered absent. Your attendance grade is derived from two components: Physical presence in class (Subject to change pending Rowan University policies and/or changes in the COVID-19 situation) Brief reflections after open work class days, due by 11:59 PM to Canvas on the given class day. Days when reflections are due will always be announced in class. #tidytuesday extra credit Starting in mid-October, there will be weekly extra credit opportunities. 4.2 Additional attendance information Note that these policies are subject to change if Rowan University pivots to remote instruction. Any changes will be announced both in class and in writing. To be considered “present” in class, you must participate in class through coding engagement. This semester, participation means you are engaging with our class materials only (not your other classes!) during class time. Evidence of participation includes: Coding along with live-coding demonstrations Doing class exercises or class homework (not work for other classes), in small groups or independently, during flipped-structure and/or open work lab days. When required, submitting your reflection on your coding progress on flipped-structure days to Canvas. If you have an excused absence or take a personal day on a day when a reflection is due, we will determine an extended deadline on a case-by-case basis. 4.2.1 Attendance grade calculation You begin the semester with 40/40 attendance points. You lose a point for every day that you are absent without prior arrangement of an excused absence or personal day (except extremely extenuating circumstances), OR do not submit a reflection for a given day when it is required. To be clear: If you attend class on a flipped work day but do not submit a reflection, you will be marked absent. If you are 15 or more minutes late to class without any associated reason (this can be discussed with Dr. Spielman after the fact), you may be subject to a partial or full absence deduction. If you are regularly 15 minutes late to class, this may result in absences. 4.2.2 Excused absences Reasonable requests for excused absences with reasonable reasons will almost always be granted. You may be asked to provide documentation depending on the circumstances. Please reach out at least 24 hours in advance of anticipated excused absence. Note that your request is NOT formally granted until you receive a positive confirmation from me. Please also be aware that I am required by Rowan University policy to alert the Dean of Students’ office if a student misses three or more consecutive days of class, even if you were excused. If you are in this circumstance, let’s talk about it. 4.2.3 Personal Class Days You are entitled to three personal class periods all semester. A personal day is different from an excused absence, which requires a formal reason for being excused. Instead, a personal day is effectively a day where you are allowed to skip class without any good reason. You must notify me by the time that the class period begins if you want to take a personal day. Please make sure to use this personal days when you need to take care of your mental, emotional, and physical health, or if you have an exceptionally busy week with other classes and need to prioritize other activities that day/week. One class period = one 75 minute period, of which there are four per week (1 Tuesday, 2 Wednesday, 1 Thursday) per week. You cannot use all three personal days within a given week, unless we have previously coordinated it. 4.2.4 Catching up if you miss class All classes will be recorded (to the best of our ability given the highly flipped class structure) and disseminated to all students after each class day. Therefore, if you have an extended absence due to COVID-19 illness or a similarly extenuating circumstance, you can still engage with all class materials. We will discuss specific assignment extensions on a case-by-case basis. 4.3 Final grade boundaries Your final grade will be converted to a percentage as shown below. Percentages for final grades are rounded UP at 0.5. For example, a final grade of 89.5 rounds to an A-, and a final grade of 89.4 rounds to a B+. A = 93 - 100% A- = 90 - 92% B+ = 87 - 89% B = 83 - 86% B- = 80 - 82% C+ = 77 - 79% C = 73 - 76% C- = 70 - 72% D+ = 67 - 69% D = 63 - 66% D- = 60 - 62% F = below 60% "],["additional-course-information-and-policies.html", "5 Additional Course Information and Policies 5.1 Email Policy and Communication Standards 5.2 Late Assignment Policy 5.3 Regrade Policy 5.4 Academic Integrity Policy", " 5 Additional Course Information and Policies 5.1 Email Policy and Communication Standards 5.1.1 Email Hours Dr. Spielman does NOT regularly check email during: Monday - Thursday, 6 pm - 8 am Friday after 4 pm Any time on the weekends Although I may check email during these times, there is no guarantee. Therefore, if you email on Saturday, therefore, do not expect a response until Monday (although it is definitely possible I might reply!). Similarly, if you email after 7 pm, do not expect a response until the following day. If you don’t hear from me for &gt;24 hours, email me again!!! I get &gt;50 emails a day - sometimes they get lost!! I am NEVER trying to ignore you! 5.1.2 Seeking help on code When seeking assistance or feedback on code, it is absolutely critical that you share with me the full information I need to understand your circumstance. I literally cannot help you unless you send me all of this information: Provide me with the full line(s) of code you ran Provide me with the full error message and/or full output you received from R If the code is more involved than 1-2 lines, provide me with information for where in your RStudio Cloud project I can find the code of interest (what file and what line) 5.2 Late Assignment Policy Assignments are generally due at 1 pm on Tuesdays to Canvas, with late penalties as follows: Submitted by Tuesday 11:59 PM: -10% Submitted by Wednesday 11:59 PM: -20% Submitted by Thursday 11:59 PM: -30% [Final deadline] Submitted by Friday 11:59 PM: -40% These late penalties and deadlines are waived if you coordinate a later deadline with Dr. Spielman on a case-by-case basis. Except in cases of emergency or other extentuating circumstances, excused late submissions must be APPROVED by Dr. Spielman at least 48 hours before the deadline. You are allowed to submit ONE late assignment by Wednesday 11:59 PM without penalty, as long as you alert Dr. Spielman you are using your late assignment by the official deadline. 5.3 Regrade Policy There are two circumstances which may merit an assignment regrade: The points were added up incorrectly. If you notice a clear mistake in grading, please bring it to Dr. Spielman’s attention immediately, and it will be immediately fixed! If you notice that you should have gotten a lower grade, just don’t ask me to fix the mistake :) You believe points were deducted from an answer incorrectly and you should have received additional credit. This requires a formal regrade request. You must fill out and submit this regrade form within two weeks of receiving the disputed grade. 5.4 Academic Integrity Policy Plagiarism is taken very seriously in this course and at Rowan University as a whole. You are expected to always and only submit YOUR OWN CODE. Recommendations for success: You should always feel free to contact me before the deadline if you are unsure if your code may, perhaps inadvertently, be plagiarized. When in doubt, ask!!!!! THERE IS NO SHAME IN ASKING FOR HELP! I LOVE HELPING! However, there is a lot of shame in submitting work that you did not do. All instances of academic integrity violations will be reported to the university. If a classmate asks you to send them your code and then proceeds to submit your code, you will be regarded as equally culpable. Please, just don’t do it. I beg you, don’t do it. I will not show you any mercy. I have a lot of experience with R programming, and I can tell if your code is yours or copied from some stackoverflow post. Cheating is not an acceptable alternative for getting help or seeking an extension on an assignment. If you work with me, I will work with you! But, if you cheat, there will be paperwork and consequences of a minimum Level 2 Academic Integrity Violation.
