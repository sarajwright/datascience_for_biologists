"],["course-description-and-requirements.html", "2 Course Description and Requirements", " 2 Course Description and Requirements Modern-day biological research produces volumes of data that all scientists need the skills to analyze. In this course, students will learn and apply foundational concepts in data science, including data visualization, wrangling, modeling, and communicating using open-source programming and reproducible frameworks. This course assumes no background in any computer programming or other computational skills. Upon completing this course, students will be able to: Apply the R statistical computing language (notably the “tidyverse” packages) to visualize, interpret, manipulate, and model (light modeling!) data Communicate data analyses using professional markup languages Utilize version control for code and data management, communication, and reproducibility Develop and address scientific questions using reproducible data science techniques There are no additional requirements for this course beyond having a computer (or tablet with external keyboard) with WiFi. "],["covid-19-policy.html", "3 COVID-19 Policy 3.1 Mask Policy 3.2 Illness and exposure Policy", " 3 COVID-19 Policy This classroom will prioritize safety and health as necessary prerequisites to learning. 3.1 Mask Policy The classroom mask policy is aligned with the Rowan University mask policy: Rowan is requiring all students, faculty and staff, regardless of vaccination status, to wear masks in all classrooms, lecture halls and laboratories for at least the first two weeks of the fall semester, Sept. 1-14. To be allowed in our indoor classroom and learning spaces, you must be wearing a mask, regardless of your vaccination status. In-person learning during a global pandemic is a privilege. Removing your mask in any way, including not covering your nose, is a sign that you do not wish to take advantage of this privilege. You will not be allowed to enter the classroom without a properly-worn mask. If you remove your mask in any way for any amount of time, you will be immediately asked to leave the classroom and you will be regarded as fully ABSENT. There are no exceptions. 3.2 Illness and exposure Policy If you are experiencing ANY cold/flu symptoms or other COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. loss of taste/smell) in any way, or you have had a known COVID-10 exposure, you will not be allowed in the classroom without a negative COVID test obtained within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. All such absences will be considered FULLY EXCUSED with no penalty. "],["grading-policies.html", "4 Grading policies 4.1 Final grade boundaries 4.2 Final grade calculations", " 4 Grading policies 4.1 Final grade boundaries Your final grade will be converted to a percentage and then to a letter grade according to the table below. These grade boundaries are subject to change, but cutoffs here correspond to the lowest letter grade you can receive for the corresponding percentage. Percentages for final grades are rounded UP at 0.5. For example, a final grade of 89.5 rounds to an A-, and a final grade of 89.4 rounds to a B+. A = 93 - 100% A- = 90 - 92% B+ = 87 - 89% B = 83 - 86% B- = 80 - 82% C+ = 77 - 79% C = 73 - 76% C- = 70 - 72% D+ = 67 - 69% D = 63 - 66% D- = 60 - 62% F = below 60% 4.2 Final grade calculations This relative contribution of Attendance/Participation is subject to change based on COVID-19. Your final grade will be determined by three different components as follows: Weekly Assignments (60%) You can expect one assignment each week of the semester, with the lowest grade dropped (or, with one assignment skipped, depending on your perspective). You are expected to complete assignments using your own code, but you are strongly encouraged to work in groups on assignments to master the topics and skills. Final independent project (15%) You will have a final independent class project analyzing a data set of your choosing. More details will be announced as the semester progresses. Attendance and participation (25%) You are expected to attend and participate through coding engagement during all classes. Attendance with lack of participation is considered FULLY absent. Evidence of participation includes: Coding along with live-coding exercises Doing class work or engaging with class concepts more generally during “open work days.” Doing class exercises during flipped-structure “lab” days Working on non-class material during class time will constitute an absence. Your attendance grade is determined as follows: You begin the semester with 40 attendance points. You lose a point for every day that you are absent without prior arrangement of an excused absence or personal day (except extremely extenuating circumstances). You are allowed to miss class for two reasons: Excused absences: Reasonable requests for excused absences with reasonable reasons will almost always be granted. You may be asked to provide documentation depending on the circumstances. Note: I am required by Rowan University policy to alert the Dean of Students’ office if a student misses three or more consecutive days of class, even if you were excused. If you are in this circumstance, let’s talk about it. Personal days: You are entitled to three personal class periods** all semester. A personal day is not an excused absence. It is a day that you are allowed to skip class without any good reason, as long as you notify me by the time of class. 1 class period = 1 75 minute period. There are four of those per week. You cannot use all three personal days within a given week, unless we have previously coordinated it.

Therefore, if you email on Saturday, therefore, do not expect a response until Monday (although it is definitely possible I might reply!). Similarly, if you email after 7 pm, do not expect a response until the following day. If you don’t hear from me for &gt;24 hours, email me again!!! I get &gt;50 emails a day - sometimes they get lost!! I am NEVER trying to ignore you! 5.2.2 Communication Standards: Email professionalism 5.2.3 Communication Standards: Seeking help on code 5.3 Late Assignment Policy Assignments are generally due at 1 pm on Tuesdays to Canvas, with late penalties as follows: Submitted by Tuesday 11:59 PM: -10% Submitted by Wednesday 11:59 PM: -20% Submitted by Thursday 11:59 PM: -30% [Final deadline] Submitted by Friday 11:59 PM: -40% These late penalities and deadlines are waived if you coordinate a later deadline with Dr. Spielman on a case by case basis. Except in cases of emergency, excused late submissions must be APPROVED by Dr. Spielman at least 48 hours before the deadline. You are allowed to submit ONE late assignment by Wednesday 11:59 PM without penalty, as long as you alert Dr. Spielman you are using your late assignment by the official deadline. 5.4 Regrade Policy There are two circumstances which may merit an assignment regrade: The points were added up incorrectly. If you notice a mistake in grading, please bring it to Dr. Spielman’s attention immediatelty and it will be immediately fixed. You believe points were deducted from an answer incorrectly and you should have received additional credit. This requires a formal regrade request. You must fill out and submit this regrade form within two weeks of receiving the disputed grade. ## Academic Integrity Policy "],["rowan-university-policies.html", "6 Rowan University Policies", " 6 Rowan University Policies As a student at Rowan University, you are expected to fully adhere to all university-wide academic policies outlined, here.
