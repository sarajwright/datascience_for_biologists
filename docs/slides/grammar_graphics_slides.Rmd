# Identifying components of a plot

```{r, echo=F, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
box_plain

**Aesthetics**: How is the data *mapped onto* visual components of the plot?
+ X-axis?
+ Y-axis?
+ Colors? Shapes? Sizes?

**Geometries**: What *shapes* aka *geometric objects* are displayed in the plot?

# Let's practice

<br><br>

+ What variable is on the X-axis? What *type* of data is it?
<br><br>
+ What variable is on the Y-axis? What *type* of data is it?
<br><br>
+ Are there colors or fills? Are they "just colors" or are they *aesthetics*?
<br><br>
+ What are the geometries in the plot?
<br><br>
+ What *interpretations* can we make about the plot? What question does the plot address or not address? (there are MANY right answers here!). 
<br><br>
+ What might the underlying dataset actually look like? *What variables (columns) are likely present?*
