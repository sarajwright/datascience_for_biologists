# How will we do it?

- Learning the "tidyverse" framework in the R statistical computing language. *You will be coding!*
<br><br>
- We will use a website called **RStudio Cloud** to write code in the browser - no downloads!
  - **Make a FREE account** at [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). This is not affiliated with Rowan (can be any email).
  - Make sure your displayed name is *identifiable* with your (preferred) First and Last name
  - We will start using the website *next week*. Stay tuned!

<br><br>

- You will *need* a computer
- You may *want* a dual monitor setup at home

# What will you be able to do after this class?

- Make _reproducible_ figures from data ("data visualization", or as the cool kids say, "dataviz") using computer code
<br><br>
- Manipulate and work with datasets using _reproducible_ computer code
<br><br>
- Create _reproducible_ professional reports with integrated figures, text, and code.
<br><br>
- Learn how to find trends in your data with *linear models* and *logistic regression*
<br><br>
- Learn how to use *version control* to never again have this:
  - `paper.docx`
  - `paper-final.docx`
  - `paper-final1.docx`
  - `paper-final2.docx`
  - `paper-final-final.docx`
  - `paper-final-final1.docx`
<br><br>
- Be a part of the amazing `#rstats` community

# What else will you leave this class with?

+ Independence and *autodidacticism*
<br><br>
+ Confidence, pride, and bragging rights
<br><br>
+ Vastly improved problem-solving and critical thinking (but *actually* this time) skills
<br><br>
+ Organizational skills

**I cannot directly teach you these skills. I can only provide you with the environment, resources, and support for you to master them yourselves. This class provides that opportunity!**

---
# What will this class NOT teach you?

- The entire `R` language
<br><br>
- "Computer programming" in the traditional sense of the term (if/else, for loops, writing functions, data structures, functional programming, object-oriented programming, etc.)
<br><br>
- Web development or software development
<br><br>
- Deep learning/artificial intelligence
  - We will discuss concepts in machine learning, but this is not an ML class
  - But let's be real: literally half the time someone says "AI", they mean "linear regression."
<br><br>
- Statistical tests that are taught in Biometry (*t*-tests, $\chi^2$ tests, etc.)
<br><br>
- The skills you learn here will make it *much easier* to pursue all of the above going forward

- Practice, practice, practice. Do the exercises over and over again, *until you are SO bored you can't take it.*
<br><br>
- Take advantage of the resources I provide. *Don't try and reinvent the wheel, because I sort of just did it for you. Stay tuned!*
<br><br>
- Start assignments *early*. 
  - *SLEEPING is the best way to find errors in your code.*
<br><br>
- Communicate with me *in a timely fashion* and come to office hours when possible
]

# How do set yourself up for FAILURE?

- Start assignments within 48 hours of the deadline
<br><br>
- Skip the practice exercises, only do them once, or "just read them" instead of *engaging*.
<br><br>
- Wait to email me until the day before the deadline - I will not have time to help you
<br><br>
- Randomly google _instead of_ using the resources I provide
<br><br>
- Try to code out _without_ using the resources 
<br><br>
- Try to write "all your code" at once instead of going one step at a time.

**Submit code that you did not write and/or share code with someone else who then submits your code. Academic integrity is taken extremely seriously in this class. I can tell when your R code isn't your R code. Just don't try it. You will be reported for _minimum_ Level 2 violation.**

# We are going to hit the ground running

- First HW is posted and due **next Thursday 9/9/21 at 1 pm**. This is the only homework not due on a Tuesday. 
<br><br>
- We will begin coding next Wednesday.
<br><br>
- *Add/drop ends on Friday September 11th*. Rowan has said there will not be a P/NC option this fall.

# Answers to your comments/questions

---

## Will seating arrangements be socially distanced still?


>To the extent possible, YES. However, Rowan has removed all capacity limits from campus spaces, so there is no guarantee we can achieve social distancing at all times. **If you are uncomfortable, please speak to me.**
>
>During flipped class times, you are encouraged to spread out _heavily_ into the atrium and/or second floor couches. Note that flipped classes are not the same as "attendance optional." Rowan policies this semester require in-person instruction and attendance. 

---

##  When will we get grades by?

> You can expect all assignments to be graded within two weeks of submission.
> All class grades will be finalized before you submit your final project so you will know exactly where you stand.

---

## Can we take exams at home?

> _No, because there are no exams!!!_ 
  
--

## Will you provide "study guides" and "skeleton notes" for us?

> Oh, yes. Oooooh, yes. Stay tuned :) 

---

## Can we watch the recordings _instead_ of coming to class?

> Unless you have an excused absence or are taking a personal day, no. Rowan's policies do not allow for remote attendance this semester. Please reach out to the Academic Success Center (successcenter@rowan.edu) if you want to try and get accommodations for any class.
  
  
---

## When will we hear back from you if we email?

> I will always answer you as soon as possible during my email-checking hours (see syllabus).
> If you do not hear from me after 24 hours when I should be checking email, email me again! I get >50 emails a day and sometimes they get lost. I am never trying to ignore you.
  
---

## Last year, lack of communication between professors and students made class much harder. What will communication be like for this class?

> I will use Canvas announcements _regularly_ to share information as soon as I have information to share.
> Any changes in deadlines will be announced _well in advance._ The only deadline changes you can expect are to _extend deadlines_ to ensure you have enough time to do assignments, as needed depending on class pace and/or potential issues with the cloud platform.
> _You do not need to worry that assignments or deadlines will be changed without warning._

---

## Will there be in-person office hours?

> Currently, no. All office hours and one-on-one meetings will be conducted over Zoom. Instead, in-person office hours are effectively embedded into class as "open work days."
