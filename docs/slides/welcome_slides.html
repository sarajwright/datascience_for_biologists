# How will we do it?

- Learning the "tidyverse" framework in the R statistical computing language. *You will be coding!*
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- We will use a website called **RStudio Cloud** to write code in the browser - no downloads!
  - **Make a FREE account** at [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). This is not affiliated with Rowan (can be any email).
  - Make sure your displayed name is *identifiable* with your (preferred) First and Last name
  - We will start using the website *next week*. Stay tuned!

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- You will *need* a computer
- You may *want* a dual monitor setup at home

# Canvas vs class website

+ **BOOKMARK THIS!** All class materials live here: [https://sjspielman.github.io/datascience_for_biologists/](https://sjspielman.github.io/datascience_for_biologists/)
  + The full (subject-to-change) schedule is live
  + Link is also posted on Canvas as **Class Website**
  + Course materials are freely available under a CC-BY 4.0 license. This license protects the materials' right to be openly accessible and to be reused by anyone for any purpose, as long as their is attribution to original author (me).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+ We will use Canvas for...
  + Sending announcements and material that is *not for public consumption*
  + Assignment submissions
  + Grading
  + Truly, that is all.


---
# What can you expect?

- Weekly homeworks due **every Tuesday at 1 pm**. (65% of final grade, drop the lowest score)
  - *Communicate with me EARLY and I will work with you on extensions.*
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Final *independent* project (20%)
  - Exploratory analysis on a dataset of your choosing
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Attendance and participation (15%)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Classes will always be recorded, but technical difficulties can happen leading to "lost" lecture records. This has happened before, and it might happen again. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- THERE ARE NO EXAMS OR QUIZZES.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Weekly extra credit opportunities starting in October
  - Remember, extra credit is not a substitute for class work.
  
---

# What can you expect?

- Lecture/labs will be "indistinguishable" class time. We will naturally go back and forth among "traditional" lecture (slides), live coding demonstrations, and exercises
- If we use slides, they may be released after the relevant class.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Office hours will be on Zoom every **Monday 2:30-4 PM**
  - One Zoom to rule them all
  - No appointment necessary
  - But, we also have *in-person office hours embedded into class.*
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- All one-on-one appointments should be scheduled via email. *Email me a week in advance of when you want to meet. My time fills up extremely quickly - do not rely on getting last-minute help!*


---
# Communicating with Dr. Spielman 

- Email _availability_ hours are Monday-Thursday 8 am-6 pm and Friday 8 am-4pm
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- If you write an email, please make sure it is *professional*
  - Opens with an address ("Dear Dr. Spielman", "Hi Professor", etc.)
  - if you are requesting help with code, I need *all the information*
  - Closes with a signature ("-your name", "Sincerely, your name")
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- You will not hear back from me if you email speilman@rowan.edu. That's not my name.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Should we have a Slack or discord?

---
# What will you be able to do after this class?

- Make _reproducible_ figures from data ("data visualization", or as the cool kids say, "dataviz") using computer code
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Manipulate and work with datasets using _reproducible_ computer code
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Create _reproducible_ professional reports with integrated figures, text, and code.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Learn how to find trends in your data with *linear models* and *logistic regression*
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Learn how to use *version control* to never again have this:
  - `paper.docx`
  - `paper-final.docx`
  - `paper-final1.docx`
  - `paper-final2.docx`
  - `paper-final-final.docx`
  - `paper-final-final1.docx`
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Be a part of the amazing `#rstats` community

---
# What else will you leave this class with?

+ Independence and *autodidacticism*
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+ Confidence, pride, and bragging rights
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+ Vastly improved problem-solving and critical thinking (but *actually* this time) skills
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+ Organizational skills

--

**I cannot directly teach you these skills. I can only provide you with the environment, resources, and support for you to master them yourselves. This class provides that opportunity!**

---
# What will this class NOT teach you?

- The entire `R` language
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- "Computer programming" in the traditional sense of the term (if/else, for loops, writing functions, data structures, functional programming, object-oriented programming, etc.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Web development or software development
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Deep learning/artificial intelligence
  - We will discuss concepts in machine learning, but this is not an ML class
  - But let's be real: literally half the time someone says "AI", they mean "linear regression."
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Statistical tests that are taught in Biometry (*t*-tests, `\(\chi^2\)` tests, etc.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- The skills you learn here will make it *much easier* to pursue all of the above going forward

.pull-right[

- Practice, practice, practice. Do the exercises over and over again, *until you are SO bored you can't take it.*
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Take advantage of the resources I provide. *Don't try and reinvent the wheel, because I sort of just did it for you. Stay tuned!*
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Start assignments *early*. 
  - *SLEEPING is the best way to find errors in your code.*
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Communicate with me *in a timely fashion* and come to office hours when possible
]

---

# How do set yourself up for FAILURE?

- Start assignments within 48 hours of the deadline
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Skip the practice exercises, only do them once, or "just read them" instead of *engaging*.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Wait to email me until the day before the deadline - I will not have time to help you
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Randomly google _instead of_ using the resources I provide
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Try to code out _without_ using the resources 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Try to write "all your code" at once instead of going one step at a time.

**Submit code that you did not write and/or share code with someone else who then submits your code. Academic integrity is taken extremely seriously in this class. I can tell when your R code isn't your R code. Just don't try it. You will be reported for _minimum_ Level 2 violation.**

# We are going to hit the ground running

- First HW is posted and due **next Thursday 9/9/21 at 1 pm**. This is the only homework not due on a Tuesday. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- We will begin coding next Wednesday.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- *Add/drop ends on Friday September 11th*. Rowan has said there will not be a P/NC option this fall.

# Answers to your comments/questions

---

## Will seating arrangements be socially distanced still?


&gt;To the extent possible, YES. However, Rowan has removed all capacity limits from campus spaces, so there is no guarantee we can achieve social distancing at all times. **If you are uncomfortable, please speak to me.**
&gt;
&gt;During flipped class times, you are encouraged to spread out _heavily_ into the atrium and/or second floor couches. Note that flipped classes are not the same as "attendance optional." Rowan policies this semester require in-person instruction and attendance. 

---

##  When will we get grades by?

&gt; You can expect all assignments to be graded within two weeks of submission.
&gt; All class grades will be finalized before you submit your final project so you will know exactly where you stand.

---

## Can we take exams at home?

&gt; _No, because there are no exams!!!_ 
  
--

## Will you provide "study guides" and "skeleton notes" for us?

&gt; Oh, yes. Oooooh, yes. Stay tuned :) 

---

## Can we watch the recordings _instead_ of coming to class?

&gt; Unless you have an excused absence or are taking a personal day, no. Rowan's policies do not allow for remote attendance this semester. Please reach out to the Academic Success Center (successcenter@rowan.edu) if you want to try and get accommodations for any class.
  
  
---

## When will we hear back from you if we email?

&gt; I will always answer you as soon as possible during my email-checking hours (see syllabus).
&gt; If you do not hear from me after 24 hours when I should be checking email, email me again! I get &gt;50 emails a day and sometimes they get lost. I am never trying to ignore you.
  
---

## Last year, lack of communication between professors and students made class much harder. What will communication be like for this class?

&gt; I will use Canvas announcements _regularly_ to share information as soon as I have information to share.
&gt; Any changes in deadlines will be announced _well in advance._ The only deadline changes you can expect are to _extend deadlines_ to ensure you have enough time to do assignments, as needed depending on class pace and/or potential issues with the cloud platform.
&gt; _You do not need to worry that assignments or deadlines will be changed without warning._

---

## Will there be in-person office hours?

&gt; Currently, no. All office hours and one-on-one meetings will be conducted over Zoom. Instead, in-person office hours are effectively embedded into class as "open work days."
