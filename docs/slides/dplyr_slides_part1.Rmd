# Data frame in, data frame out.

**The _first argument_ for most `dplyr` verbs (functions) is a data frame (tibble).**

**Those verbs all _return_ a data frame (tibble).** 


### THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT!

---

# Diving in with `filter()`


```{r}
# Reminder of the dataset:
diamonds
```

---

# Diving in with `filter()`

### Goal: Subset the data to only Premium quality diamonds


+ First argument: a data frame
+ Additional argument(s): **logical statements** (code that gives `TRUE` OR `FALSE`) about which rows you want to keep
+ *We can directly refer to columns within `dplyr` code*


```{r}
# Keep only Premium quality diamonds:
filter(diamonds, cut == "Premium")
```

---

# Using pipe is the preferred style

```{r}
# Not preferred:
# filter(diamonds, cut == "Premium")

# Also not preferred:
# diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Premium")

# THIS!!!!
# STARS STARS STARS! THIS WAY!
diamonds %>%   #<<
  filter(cut == "Premium")   #<<
```
---

# Cautionary tales

```{r}
head(diamonds)
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "premium")
```

---


# Cautionary tales

```{r}
head(diamonds)
```


```{r, error=TRUE}
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Premuim")
```

---

# Cautionary tales

```{r}
head(diamonds)
```


```{r, error=TRUE}
diamonds %>%
  filter(quality == "Premium")
```

---


# Cautionary tales

```{r}
head(diamonds)
```


```{r, error=TRUE}
diamonds %>%
  filter(CUT == "Premium")
```

---

# Cautionary tales

```{r}
head(diamonds)
```


```{r, error=TRUE}
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut = "Premium")
```

---

# Cautionary tales

```{r}
head(diamonds)
```


```{r, error=TRUE}
diamonds 
  %>% filter(cut == "Premium")
```

---

# We can have multiple conditions in `filter()`

+ Using a comma in filter acts as "and" (`&`). 
+ Keep all rows where ALL conditions are `TRUE`

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Premium", color == "I") #<<
```

---

# We can have multiple conditions in `filter()`


```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Premium", color == "I", carat > 1)
```

---


# Separate onto new lines when code gets too long

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Premium",  #<<
         color == "I",     #<<
         carat > 1)      #<<
```

**Caution!!** Make sure the commas are always on at the _end of a line_

---

# Goal: Subset to only "Ideal and "Premium" diamonds

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Ideal", 
         cut == "Premium")
```

--

**That code DID WORK.** It retained all rows whose `cut` equaled "Ideal" **AND** "Premium"! ....But there are no such rows!!


**To reiterate: The code worked perfectly fine, but it didn't do what you might have expected. This is a type of a bug.**


---

## Recall the `%in%` operator

```{r}
colors <- c("red", "orange", "yellow")
"red" %in% colors
"blue" %in% colors
```

---

# Get rows with _either_ cut using `%in%`, NOT `==`

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut %in% c("Ideal", "Premium")) #<<
```

---
# Helpful tips


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Avoid hardcoding by defining this separately
cuts <- c("Ideal", "Premium") #<<
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut %in% cuts) 
```


**Below might seem like it works, but it DOES NOT!**

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  # Why is this NO NO NO NO NO NO NO????
  filter(cut == c("Ideal", "Premium")) #<<
```

---

# Have as many options as you want:

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut %in% c("Ideal", "Premium", "Good"))
```

---

# One reason filtering is important:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, 
                     y = price)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3)
```

--

But what if I *only* want to plot diamonds that cost less than $1000?

---

# Plotting filtered data 

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(price < 1000) -> diamonds_cheaper

ggplot(diamonds_cheaper, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3)
```

---

# Plotting filtered data 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
diamonds %>%
  filter(price < 1000) -> diamonds_cheaper

ggplot(diamonds_cheaper, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3)
```

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 3}
diamonds %>%
  filter(price < 1000) %>%  #<<
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +  #<<
    geom_point(size = 3)
```
]
.pull-right[
**Caution:** Be careful to use `%>%` and `+` in the right place. Using the wrong one in the wrong place is a **common bug**!
]
---


# Working with columns with `select()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
diamonds %>%
  select(price, cut)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
```{r}
diamonds %>%
  select(-price, -cut)
```
]
---

# There is a lot of magic in `select()`

```{r}
head(diamonds)

diamonds %>%
  select(price, everything())
```

---


# Creating new columns with `mutate()`

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  mutate(the_number_5 = 5)
```

---


# Creating new columns with `mutate()`

Again, we can directly reference existing columns: 

```{r}
# 'x' is measured in mm
diamonds %>%
  mutate(x_in_cm = x/10)
```

**New column names should always begin with a LETTER and only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.**

---

# What if I want my new variable to be first?

```{r}
# 'x' is measured in mm
diamonds %>%
  mutate(x_in_cm = x/10) %>%
  select(x_in_cm, everything())
```

---


# Also bring `x` forward for easy comparison

> This is part of checking that your `mutate()` command worked. Use your eyes to confirm that `x_in_cm` really is 10*x

```{r}
# 'x' is measured in mm
diamonds %>%
  mutate(x_in_cm = x/10) %>%
  select(x_in_cm, x, everything())
```

---
# This the magic of the pipe

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(carat < 0.5) %>%
  select(carat, price)
```

---

# ONE LINE AT A TIME

## IF YOU DO NOT GO ONE LINE AT A TIME, YOU WILL DO VERY VERY POORLY.

## I REALLY CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH. 

## ONE. LINE. AT. A TIME.

---

# Make sure this works FIRST


```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(carat < 0.5)
```

---

# Then, add the next line

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(carat < 0.5) %>%
  select(carat, price)
```

---

# An smallish example of real-word piping

> This code should not make sense to you, don't worry!

<br><br>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
models %>%
  separate(name, into=c("id", "dataset", "trash"), sep = "\\.") %>%
  replace_na(list(dataset = "PANDIT"))  %>%
  select(-trash) %>%
  group_by(id, datatype) %>%
  mutate(num = 1:n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_longer(AIC:BIC, 
               names_to = "ic_type", 
               values_to = "best_model") %>%
  mutate(best_matrix = str_replace(best_model, "\\+.+", "")) -> processed_models
```

---

# So far...

+ `glimpse()` for data frame overviews
+ `filter()` for subsetting rows (observations)
+ `select()` for keeping/removing columns
+ `mutate()` for creating columns


+ Other `dplyr` functions you will see in exercises this week (and will be on the homework)
  + `arrange()`
  + `rename()`
  + `distinct()`
  + `tally()` (we will learn more about this function next week, too)

# Arranging rows by a variable

```{r}
diamonds %>%

---

# For _descending_ order:

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  arrange(desc(carat)) #<<
```

---


# Renaming columns


```{r}
# rename(newname = oldname) !!!
diamonds %>%
  rename(width = x) #<<
```

---


# Removing duplicate rows


```{r}
# boring, since all rows are unique!
diamonds %>%
  distinct() #<<
```

---

# Removing duplicate rows


.pull-left[
```{r}
diamonds %>%
  select(color)

# Counting the number of rows with code
