# Guiding principle

### The goal of data visualization is to communicate. 

--

### We do not want to create plots that are...

+ **factually misleading**
+ **factually incorrect**
+ **impossible or overly difficult to interpret**
+ **so ugly that you don't even want to try interpreting them**


All figures (except the `msleep` figures) in the following slides are from [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/).

```{r out.width = '800px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "hawaii-income-bars-bad-1.png"))
```

Median income in the five counties of the state of Hawaii. Data source: 2015 Five-Year American Community Survey.

---

# Best Principle: The principle of proportional ink

> The sizes of shaded areas in a visualization need to be proportional to the data values they represent. 

**Truncating the y-axis is highly misleading.** 

--

```{r out.width = '600px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "hawaii-income-bars-good-1.png"))
```

```{r out.width = '1000px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "RI-pop-pie-1.png"))
```

Number of inhabitants in Rhode Island counties. Data source: 2010 Decennial U.S. Census.

# Best Principle: Don't use pie charts.


Pies are sized based on relative *area*. Human eyes are really bad at properly perceiving area.

```{r out.width = '800px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "tech-stocks-bad-legend-1.png"))
```

Stock price over time for four major tech companies. The stock price for each company has been normalized to equal 100 in June 2012. Data source: Yahoo Finance.

# Best Principle: Make your viewer's life easy



```{r out.width = '400px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "tech-stocks-bad-legend-1.png"))
```


--

```{r out.width = '500px', echo=F}

```

---


```{r out.width = '400px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "Aus-athletes-small-1.png"))
```

Percent body fat versus height in professional male Australian athletes. (Each point represents one athlete.) Data source: Telford and Cunningham (1991)
 
--

```{r out.width = '400px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "Aus-athletes-big.png"))

# Use trial and error to get the right style

### "Goldilocks" text size:


```{r out.width = '600px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "Aus-athletes-good-1.png"))
```

# Don't annoy your viewers, either

### People are more likely to _want_ to interpret aesthetically pleasing figures

```{r out.width = '300px', echo=F}

```{r out.width = '300px', echo=F}

```{r out.width = '700px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "mpg-cty-displ-solid-1.png"))
```

City fuel economy versus engine displacement, for popular cars released between 1999 and 2008. Each point represents one car. The point color encodes the drive train: front-wheel drive (FWD), rear-wheel drive (RWD), or four-wheel drive (4WD).

# Best Principle: Make sure your data is visible


```{r out.width = '700px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "mpg-cty-displ-transp-1.png"))
```

---

```{r out.width = '400px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "popgrowth-vs-popsize-colored-1.png"))
```

Population growth from 2000 to 2010 versus population size in 2000, for all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Every state is marked in a different color. Data source: U.S. Census Bureau

# Best principle: More is not better (less is more?)

One possible solution to the "busy-ness":

```{r out.width = '600px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "popgrowth-vs-popsize-bw-1.png"))
```

---

# Recall this dataset:

```{r, echo=T}
msleep_subvore
```

---
# How many hours do the different "vores" spend awake?

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
box_fill
```

---

```{r out.width = '800px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "box_fill_cvd_grid.png"))
```

---

# Best Principle: Ensure a colorblind-friendly palette

> In this example, color differentiation is not _needed_ to interpret the plot. In other cases when colors are needed, always check that your plot is accessible.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
box_fill +  box_fill_cb
```

---

```{r out.width = '800px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "box_fill_cb_cvd_grid.png"))
```

---

# Want manual fills (colors)?


```{r, echo = T}
myplot <- ggplot(msleep_subvore, 
       aes(x = vore, y = awake, fill = vore)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Legend name",  #<<
                    values = c("cornflowerblue", #<<
                               "coral3",          #<<
                               "blueviolet"))        #<<

print(myplot)
```

# How to check CVD friendliness

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 7, echo = T}
library(colorblindr) # installed for you our RStudio Cloud
cvd_grid(myplot)
```
