# Guiding principle

### The goal of data visualization is to communicate. 

### We do not want to create plots that are...

+ **factually misleading**
+ **factually incorrect**
+ **impossible or overly difficult to interpret**
+ **so ugly that you don't even want to try interpreting them**


All figures (except the `msleep` figures) in the following slides are from [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/), unless otherwise stated.

```{r out.width = '800px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "hawaii-income-bars-bad-1.png"))
```

Median income in the five counties of the state of Hawaii. Data source: 2015 Five-Year American Community Survey.

# Best Principle: The principle of proportional ink

> The sizes of shaded areas in a visualization need to be proportional to the data values they represent. 

**Truncating the y-axis is highly misleading.**

# A new kind of plot: Pie charts

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "RI-pop-pie-1.png"))
```

Number of inhabitants in Rhode Island counties. Data source: 2010 Decennial U.S. Census.

# Best Principle: Don't use pie charts.


Pies are sized based on relative *area*. Human eyes are really bad at properly perceiving area.

```{r out.width = '300px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "RI-pop-pie-1.png"))

Stock price over time for four major tech companies. The stock price for each company has been normalized to equal 100 in June 2012. Data source: Yahoo Finance.

# Don't annoy your viewers, either

### People are more likely to _want_ to interpret aesthetically pleasing figures, BUT not everyone always agrees on what counts as "ugly"!

```{r out.width = '700px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "mpg-cty-displ-solid-1.png"))
```

City fuel economy versus engine displacement, for popular cars released between 1999 and 2008. Each point represents one car. The point color encodes the drive train: front-wheel drive (FWD), rear-wheel drive (RWD), or four-wheel drive (4WD).

# Best Principle: Make sure your data is visible

```{r out.width = '400px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "popgrowth-vs-popsize-colored-1.png"))
```

Population growth from 2000 to 2010 versus population size in 2000, for all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Every state is marked in a different color. Data source: U.S. Census Bureau

# Best principle: More is not better (less is more?)

One possible solution to the "busy-ness":

```{r out.width = '600px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "popgrowth-vs-popsize-bw-1.png"))
```

---

# Recall this dataset:

```{r, echo=T}
msleep_subvore
```

---
# How many hours do the different "vores" spend awake?

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4, echo=F}
box_fill
```

---

```{r out.width = '800px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "box_fill_cvd_grid.png"))
```

---

# Best Principle: Ensure a colorblind-friendly palette

> In this example, color differentiation is not _needed_ to interpret the plot. In other cases when colors are needed, always check that your plot is accessible.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4, echo=F}
box_fill +  box_fill_cb
```

---

```{r out.width = '800px', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path, "box_fill_cb_cvd_grid.png"))

# Data visualization and "bullshit"

https://www.callingbullshit.org/ 

>What do we mean, exactly, by bullshit and calling bullshit? As a first approximation:
>
>Bullshit involves language, statistical figures, data graphics, and other forms of presentation intended to persuade by impressing and overwhelming a reader or listener, with a blatant disregard for truth and logical coherence.
>
>Calling bullshit is a performative utterance, a speech act in which one publicly repudiates something objectionable. The scope of targets is broader than bullshit alone. You can call bullshit on bullshit, but you can also call bullshit on lies, treachery, trickery, or injustice.
